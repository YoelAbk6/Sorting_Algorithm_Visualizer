# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
A visualization of Insertion, Heap, and Bubble sort using Pygame

The interface allows to:

* Choose between Insertion Sort (I), Heap Sort (H), and Bubble Sort (B)
* Start the sorting by pressing the space bar
* Alternate between ascending and descending order by pressing A or D
* Reset the current array to its original unsorted form by pressing R
* Generate a new unsorted array by pressing N

After each iteration, the running time of the current algorithm is displayed.

The program helps to understand the different ways in which the data can be sorted, and how much difference there is between a running time of `O(n^2)` and `O(nlog(n))`
